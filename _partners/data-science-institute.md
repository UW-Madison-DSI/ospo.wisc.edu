We were founded by Kyle Cranmer, the director of the University of Wisconsin Data Science Institute. A key component of Kyle's strategic vision for DSI is to robustly support open source efforts and to provide organizational, financial, and governance models for other data science institutes and centers around the country. Our offices are located alongside the DSI offices in the McArdle Building on the UW-Madison Campus.
