<h1 class="uw-mini-bar">Call for OSPO Internship Projects</h1>

<p>The Open Source Program Office (OSPO) is looking to connect interns with meaningful open-source projects as part of our internship program. The program would match projects with interns and begin activities in Spring 2025. OSPO support would consist of a student training session and weekly group check-ins for the duration of the internship period until Fall 2025.</p>

<p>If your project could benefit from dedicated contributors, we would like to invite you to submit a proposal outlining your needs and how interns could assist you. This is a fantastic opportunity for your project to receive valuable support while offering interns practical experience and the chance to contribute to impactful work.</p>

<p>Please include the following in your proposal:</p>

<p><b>Project Overview:</b> A brief description of your project, its goals, and its current status.</p>

<p><b>Internship Tasks:</b> Specific tasks or areas where interns could contribute, such as coding, documentation, testing, etc.</p>

<p><b>Mentorship:</b> Details about who would be available to guide and mentor the interns during their time on the project.</p>

<p><b>Desired Skills:</b> Any particular skills or knowledge that would be beneficial for contributors to have.</p>

<p>If you are interested, please send your proposal to ospo@datascience.wisc.edu by Friday, November 15. Afterwards, we will publish the project descriptions as part of the student application, and students from both UW-Madison and Madison College will have the opportunity to apply to your project. We are eager to facilitate connections that can drive both your project and the professional growth of the interns.</p>


<p>Thank you for considering this collaboration opportunity. The OSPO looks forward to your response and to potentially working together to advance your project.</p>
