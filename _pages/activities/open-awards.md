<h1 class="page-title uw-mini-bar">The Annual UW-Madison Open Awards</h1>

<h2>About the Awards</h2>

<p> The UW-Madison Open Awards are sponsored by the Data Science Institute, Open Source Program Office, and the Libraries along with support from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. The awards recognize and celebrate those using open practices in their work and who are inspiring others to do the same. The awards also recognize that Open practices vary across academic communities including: open access publishing, open data, open education, open source software and hardware, open science, and more. All of these open practices are critical to the mission of the Wisconsin Idea - enabling sharing to maximize resources and knowledge disseminations, fostering transparency, and from these ensuring greater impact of research outputs to the public good.</p>

<p>The awards include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Open Hall of Fame,</b> for individuals, projects, or teams whose open contributions have had lasting impacts, widespread adoption, or driven significant change for their communities during the course of their careers.</li>
	<li><b>Open Scholarship,</b> for faculty and research professionals at any stage of their career who have demonstrated leadership and commitment to open practices.</li>
	<li><b>Open Source,</b> for outstanding contributions to open source.</li>
</ul>		


<p>Winners are selected from an annual call for nominations by the Open Awards Review Committee. Winners receive a $1,000 award, and the Hall of Fame awardees have their names displayed in the Digital Scholarship Hub located in Memorial Library.</p>
