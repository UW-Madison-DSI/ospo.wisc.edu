<h2>Join us for the inaugural UW-Madison Open Awards!</h2>

<p>This year's <a href="https://bazaar.datascience.wisc.edu/">Data Science Research Bazaar</a> will host the inaugural UW-Madison Open Awards on <b>Thursday, March 20th at 9:30 a.m.</b> in the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery DeLuca Forum. The UW-Madison Open Awards are sponsored by the Data Science Institute, Open Source Program Office, and the Libraries with support from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. The awards recognize and celebrate those using open practices in their work and who are inspiring others to do the same. The awards also recognize that Open practices vary across academic communities including: open access publishing, open data, open education, open source software and hardware, open scholarship, and more.</p>

<p>The awards will honor winners for the Open Source Award and the Open Scholarship Award as well as inaugural inductees to the UW-Madison Open Hall of Fame.</p>
