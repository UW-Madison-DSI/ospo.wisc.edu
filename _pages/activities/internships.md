<p class="page-description">The inaugural UW-Madison OSPO Internship Program will begin in Spring 2025. In this OSPO-funded program, students will learn fundamental skills for open source development through training sessions and weekly check-ins with the OSPO while contributing to a variety of meaningful open source projects.</p>

<p> The OSPO is currently soliciting projects to be a part of this program. For more details, <a href="https://ospo.wisc.edu/blog/2024/intern-projects/">see our call for projects here.</a></p>
