<h2>How Can We Help?</h2>

<p>The Open Source Program Office in the Data Science Institute collaborates with researchers, industry, and the community to foster the development, dissemination, and potential of open source. The OSPO can work with you on strategies for sharing, translating, and using open source technology, from best practices to community building.</p>

<h3>Industry and Community Partnerships</h3>
<p>The OSPO is an "institutional API" exploring untapped potential and building partnerships within and between universities, the private sector, and government organizations. We aim to support innovation in open source and translation of open source projects with an eye towards industry and entrepreneurship applications.</p>

<h3>Campus Partnerships</h3>
<p>The OSPO will serve as a hub for community among open source practitioners, fostering awareness and networking among open source projects and their users on campus. We can also partner with you on proposals for extramural funding with an open source component.</p>
